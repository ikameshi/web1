	<h1>Who is Scout?</h1>
	<img src="scout.png" width="30%">
	<p>
Born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, the Scout is a fast-running scrapper with a baseball bat and a snarky "in-your-face" attitude. 
He is the fastest and most mobile mercenary on the battlefield unassisted. 
His Double Jump leaves slower opponents such as the Heavy struggling to keep up and helps him navigate the terrain while dodging incoming projectiles. 
Carrying a Scattergun, a Pistol, and a Bat, the Scout is an ideal class for aggressive fighting and flanking. 
The Scout is a great class for quick "hit-and-run" tactics that can either sap away enemies' health or kill 
them outright due to his ability to get in, do damage, and dash away before even being noticed.
However, the Scout is tied with the Engineer, Sniper and Spy for having the lowest health of any class, 
leaving him vulnerable when he is on the front line; a fair trade-off for his ability to run in and out of
a contested hot-spot very quickly, letting him lead the team to victory without the other team even noticing in time.
The Scout is an excellent choice for completing objectives quickly. He can capture control points and push carts at twice 
the rate of any other class. Only the Scout has this ability naturally; the Demoman and Soldier only have the same ability while holding or using the Pain Train. 
His speed also makes him perfect for capturing intelligence briefcases.
